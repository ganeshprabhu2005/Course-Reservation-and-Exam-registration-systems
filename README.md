Aim
To develop a project Course Reservation and Exam Registration System using Rational Rose Software and to implement the software in Java.

PROBLEMSTATEMENT:
• Effective for Administration Purpose
• Cost effective
• Better Services

Use case Diagrams:

A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify, and organize system requirements. The use case is made up of a set of possible sequences of interactions between systems and users in a particular environment and related to a particular goal. It is represented using ellipse. Actor is any external entity that makes use of the system being modeled.

Activity Diagram:

An activity diagram is a variation or special case of a state machine in which the states or activity representing the performance of operation and transitions are triggered by the completion of operation. The purpose is to provide view of close and what is going on inside a use case or among several classes. An activity is shown as rounded box containing the name of operation.

Collaboration diagram:

A collaboration diagram is similar to sequence diagram but the message in number format. In a collaboration diagram sequence diagram is indicated by the numbering the message. A collaboration diagram, also called a communication diagram or interaction diagram, A sophisticated modeling tool can easily convert a collaboration diagram into a sequence diagram and the vice versa. A collaboration diagram resembles a flowchart that portrays the roles, functionality and behavior of individual objects as well as the overall operation of the system in real time.
